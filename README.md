Zeavim - Zeal for Vim
=====================

Description
-------------

Zeavim allows to use [Zeal](http://zealdocs.org) documentation browser directly from [Vim](http://vim.org).

This plugin was tested in GNU/Linux and Windows.

Installation
-------------

To use zeavim, you need of course to have Zeal installed. Grab it from [here](http://zealdocs.org/download.html) and install it .

### Manual installation

Install the distributed files into Vim runtime directory which is usually `~/.vim/`, or `$HOME/vimfiles` on Windows.

### Using Pathogen
If you're using pathogen, extract the file into `bundle` directory.

### Using Vundle
Just add the following line in the Vundle part of your vimrc

    Bundle 'KabbAmine/zeavim.vim'

Then proceed to the installation of the plugin with the following command:

    :BundleInstall


Usage
-----

They are 3 ways of using zeavim:

1.  `<leader>z` - To execute Zeal with the current word (Or visual selection in VISUAL mode) as a query and the file type (Sometimes file extension or a manually specified docset) as a docset.
3.  `<leader>Z` (Note the capital *z*) - To use the file type (Sometimes file extension or a manually specified docset) as a docset and specify the query manually.

4.  `<leader><leader>z` - To specify manually both query and docset.

Mapping
-------

You can easily change the mapping keys of zeavim:

    nmap NEW_MAPPING <Plug>Zeavim       " <leader>z (NORMAL mode)
    vmap NEW_MAPPING <Plug>ZVVisSelection   " <leader>z (VISUAL mode)
    nmap NEW_MAPPING <Plug>ZVKeyword      " <leader>Z
    nmap NEW_MAPPING <Plug>ZVKeyDocset      " <leader><leader>z

Or you can in a global way change the leader key in Vim (`\` by default) by putting in your vimrc:

    let mapleader="NEW_LEADER_KEY"

Commands
-------

### Main commands

For those of you who prefer using commands, here they are:

    Zeavim    " Normal
    ZvV     " VISUAL mode
    ZvK     " Type query
    ZvKD    " Type docset and query

### Specify manually a docset

If you need a lazy way to specify a docset, you can use:

    Docset DOCSET_NAME

As an example, I'm working on a `scss` file but I want to get `compass` documentation when using Zeavim, so I just need to specify manually this docset:

    Docset compass

Then Zeavim **only for the current buffer** will use `compass` as a docset.

The docset name can be completed, for that see `g:zv_lazy_docset_list` in the *Customization* part.

To revert that and get zeavim working like usually, a simple `Docset` without argument is enough.

Customization
-------------

### Location of Zeal

By default zeavim assume that *zeal* is located in `%ProgramFiles/Zeal/zeal.exe` for Windows and `/usr/bin/zeal` for UNIX systems.
You can specify Zeal's location manually by adding in your vimrc:

    if has('win32') || has('win64')
        let g:zv_zeal_directory = " path\\to\\zeal.exe\""
    else
        let g:zv_zeal_directory = "/usr/bin/zeal"
    endif

### Adding file types

Zeavim generates the zeal docset name from the extension (Or the filetype vim option) of the current file, but if you need to add some other file types, you can create in your vimrc a dictionary with the extension or the vim file type as the key and the value as the docset name:

    let g:zv_added_files_type = {
        \ 'EXTENSION': 'DOCSET_NAME',
        \ 'FILE_TYPE': 'DOCSET_NAME',
        \ }

As an example (Those file types are already included into zeavim):

    let g:zv_added_files_type = {
        \ 'cpp': 'C++',
        \ 'js': 'Javascript',
        \ 'md': 'Markdown',
        \ 'mdown': 'Markdown',
        \ 'mkd': 'Markdown',
        \ 'scss': 'Sass',
        \ }

### Disable default mappings

You can disable the default mappings by adding to your vimrc:

    let g:zv_disable_mapping = 1

### Docset name completion

When using the command `Docset`, you can get a docset name completion with `Tab` (Or with `<C-d` depending of your vim options).

If needed, you can add docset names for this completion in the variable `g:zv_lazy_docset_list`.
There is an example:

    let g:zv_lazy_docset_list = [ 'Compass', 'Bootstrap', 'Vagrant', 'Font Awesome' ]
